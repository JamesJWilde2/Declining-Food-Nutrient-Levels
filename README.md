# Visualizing the Decline in Nutrient Levels in Foods

The foods of today contain less nutrients than those of past decades, according to a growing pool of evidence. Protein, zinc, iron, calcium, iron, vitamin C, vitamin A—all of these nutrients seem to have generally become more sparse in our foods, per mass. The research into this field carries some controversy, however, as do any predictions of the decline’s actual impact. 

What follows is a quick summary of my findings, illustrated with a few key data visualizations—because in my research, I found a lack of visual displays of what, exactly, is going on.

**The Evidence**

Much of the concern over the decline in nutritional quality of foods dates back to a landmark [2004 research paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2004.10719409). The paper, which looked at USDA food composition data from 1950 to 1999, found declines in multiple key nutrients. Multiple papers have since found similar declines, including a [2014 Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13179), a [2014 eLife paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/02245), a [2017 Environmental Health Perspectives paper](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP41), and [a 2024 Foods review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10969708/).

The 2014 Nature paper looked into the nutrient levels of crops grown at elevated levels of carbon dioxide and compared them with the nutrient levels of crops grown at ambient levels of carbon dioxide. The researchers also combined their data with data from 10 other studies. They found consistent declines in protein, zinc, and iron in the crops grown at elevated levels of carbon dioxide, suggesting that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere may reduce the levels of nutrients in our foods.

I pulled the data from that paper, formatted it in a spreadsheet, and [visualized it using Flourish](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20843700/):

Meanwhile, the 2024 Foods review pulled data from 200 sources, finding nutrient declines in fruits and vegetables. In particular, the researchers pointed to USDA food composition table data that found declines in levels of calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C in many fruits and vegetables.

I again pulled the data into a spreadsheet and visualized it using Flourish. [This chart](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20821562/) shows the decline in nutrients in fruits:

While [this chart](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20822418/) shows the decline in nutrients in vegetables:

**What It Means**

Pinpointing why and how nutrients might be declining in foods, and what it means, is more murky.

Scientists have looked into three main potential causes:
- Selective breeding of crops with less nutritional value
- Depletion of nutrients in agricultural soil
- Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere diluting the concentration of nutrients in foods

Publications like [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511/), and [Chemistry World](https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/is-modern-food-lower-in-nutrients/4018578.article) have already written up detailed explorations of these potential causes. Rather than rehash those articles, I will summarize them by saying that evidence seems to point toward a combination of these three causes, with the rising level of carbon dioxide likely being the largest driver. In short, increasing levels of carbon dioxide cause plants to grow faster and take up more carbohydrates, while levels of protein and other key nutrients remain the same—thus leading to a relatively lower concentration of those nutrients. 

However, [a 2017 paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157516302113) disputed the accuracy of comparisons with historical food data, arguing that existing studies hadn’t captured all of the potential historical changes and other factors like sample sizes and degrees of ripeness. 

Regardless, researchers have continued to look into this, and studies are ongoing.

Unfortunately, research into this field is still relatively new, and the significance of this decline in nutrients is still murky. In the meantime, the recommendation from researchers is the same mundane advice you’ve probably heard countless times before: try to eat a well-balanced diet, with lots of fruits and vegetables—maybe even more fruits and veggies than before.
